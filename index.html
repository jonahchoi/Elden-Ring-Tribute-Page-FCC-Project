    <h2>What is Elden Ring?</h2>
    <p id="tribute-info">Elden Ring is a new RPG Souls-like game from From Software, creators of wildly popular series like Dark Souls and Bloodborne. The studio is known for it's extremely difficult and ruthless gameplay. You will die and you will die a lot. Elden Ring is the first entry to feature an open world, packed with stories, dungeons, monsters, and bosses galore. There are over 100 unique bosses to face all around the map and each one would steal your lunch money and make you cry for mommy. Despite that, the game is extremely rewarding and gives you such catharsis after finally beating a boss you've died to 50+ times. Elden Ring is already the best selling game of 2022 and it has received numerous high ratings from multiple sites. </p>
